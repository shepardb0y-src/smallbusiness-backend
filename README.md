My app is called the small business because I wouild like keep  building  on this project as a small business application template for small business owners. The technologies used for this project are Spring tools suite, PostgreSQL and the Java frame work. While making this project i had to think about the endpints my client would need so I thought about differnt use cases of the application. This website will be used by two types of users. The first will be the user who is looking to purchase a certain service from my client. The second user is my client reading the data from my users and keeping track of wclients who have viewed the user data. With this in my the application will accomplish the goal of organizing user service interest and allowing the client to recieve the data to reach back out to the user.

CRUD End points For Admin Modal

HTTP Method: GET	CRUD: READ	Route: "/allclients"
HTTP Method: GET	CRUD: READ	Route: â€œclient/{id}"
HTTP Method: Put 	CRUD: READ	Route: "/client/{id}"
HTTP Method: Delete	CRUD: READ	Route: "/client/{id}"


CRUD End points For User Modal

HTTP Method: GET	CRUD: READ	Route: "/allusers"
HTTP Method: GET	CRUD: READ	Route: "/user/{id}"
HTTP Method: Put 	CRUD: READ	Route: "/user/{id}"
HTTP Method: Delete	CRUD: READ	Route: "/user/{id}"


In the futere I plan on adding more end points so the client can change the services and prices manually without my intervention.
