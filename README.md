My app is called the small business beacuase i wouild like keep building the project as a small business website template for small business owners. The technologies used for this project are Spring tools suite, PostgreSQL and the Java frame work. While making this project i had to think about the endpints my client would need so i thought about differnt use cases of the website. This website will be used by two types of users. The first will be the user who is looking to purchase a certain service from my client. The second user is my client reading the data from my users and keeping track of wclients who have viewed the user data. With this in my the application will accomplish the goal of organizing user service interest and allowing the client to recieve the data to reach back out to the user.
